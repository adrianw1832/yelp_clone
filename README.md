##Yelp Clone

This project is from the week 7 weekly challenge of the Makers Academy course.
This challenge introduces Ruby on Rails to us. The premise of the project is to
create a clone of the yelp website using rails. The things we have learnt about
Sinatra and databases are basically merged together in an easy to use framework.
I do feel that it is also important to try and keep the controller and models as
thin as possible.

##Challenges

Rails is pretty opinionated so it was more about getting used to how it works
than anything being overly complicated. Pretty much a lot of it seemed really
magical. The tutorial was quite content heavy and we missed the first day
because it was a bank holiday, so it was just a lot of information in one go,
but nothing particularly difficult.

##Technologies used

Ruby on Rails, Active Records, PostgreSQL, Javascript, HTML, CSS

RSpec, Capybara

##How to install

Clone the repo and run rails server in the terminal, and follow the onscreen
instructions to set up the databases, and then visit localhost:3000.

To run the tests, run rspec in the terminal.
